Problem Motivation
As a student living in RC4, I believe it is important for our hostel to implement a management system for its facilities and common spaces. Currently, there is no organized way to manage the use of amenities like mahjong tables, pool tables, and lounges, which can be frustrating when they are constantly occupied.

Having a system in place would greatly benefit us by allowing better planning for group work and relaxation.

User Stories

Reserve a time slot for using a common facility such as the pool table, mahjong table or lounge, through an online booking system, so that I can plan my time effectively and avoid conflicts with other students.

Receive alerts or notifications if a reservation I have made is canceled or modified, so that I can make alternative plans if necessary.

View the availability of common facilities at any given time, so that I can choose a convenient time to make a reservation.

Submit feedback or report issues related to the facilities, such as damaged QR codes.
